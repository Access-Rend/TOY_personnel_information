# tooltoy-personnel_information
an easy tool for saving your personnel information, but not support CHINESE(utf-8) yet...damn


## Usage

+ first, maybe you need to know how to use CMAKE to build a cpp-project
+ then, edit the [CmakeLists.txt](too easy to describe)
+ then, edit the [main.cpp], especially in: 
  + line 44, string path = "";
  + line 19 and line 76, function add(), you can add more arguments if indeed
+ finally, use [cmake](or make, g++) to build this project 

## Optimization
+ the delete function is not good so you can rewrite it in line 32
+ lots of bad words are maybe disliked by some people, take care of them
