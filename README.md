# tooltoy-personnel_information
an easy tool for saving your personnel information into **JSON** file, but not support CHINESE(utf-8) yet...damn


## Usage

+ first, maybe you need to know how to use CMAKE to build a cpp-project
+ then, edit the **CmakeLists.txt**(too easy to describe)
+ then, edit the **main.cpp**, especially in: 
  + line 44, string path = "";
  + line 19 and line 76, function add(), you can add more arguments if indeed
+ finally, use **cmak**(or **make**, **g++**) to build this project 

## Optimization
+ the delete function is not good so you can rewrite it in line 32
+ lots of bad words are maybe disliked by some people, take care of them

## ETC
I just wanna write this program to deal my job, but thanks to **C++ Standards Committee** it's too hard to me to support CHINESE(utf-8).    
so just make it a toy present to you hot guys(Sucking lips)    ;9
